About PPDP
----------

The PPDP 2021 symposium brings together researchers from the
declarative programming communities, including those working in the
functional, logic, answer-set, and constraint handling programming
paradigms. The goal is to stimulate research in the use of logical
formalisms and methods for analyzing, performing, specifying, and
reasoning about computations, including mechanisms for concurrency,
security, static analysis, and verification.

Scope
-----

Submissions are invited on all topics related to declarative programming,
from principles to practice, from foundations to applications. 
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to

 - Language Design: domain-specific languages; interoperability;
   concurrency, parallelism and distribution; modules; functional
   languages; reactive languages; languages with objects; languages for
   quantum computing; languages inspired by biological and chemical
   computation; metaprogramming.

 - Declarative languages in artificial intelligence: logic programming;
   database languages; knowledge representation languages;
   probabilistic languages; differentiable languages.

 - Implementations: abstract machines; interpreters; compilation;
   compile-time and run-time optimization; memory management.

-   Foundations: types; logical frameworks; monads and effects; semantics.

-   Analysis and Transformation: partial evaluation; abstract interpretation;
   control flow; data flow; information flow; termination analysis; resource
   analysis; type inference and type checking; verification; validation;
   debugging; testing.

 - Tools and Applications: programming and proof environments;
   verification tools; case studies in proof assistants or interactive
   theorem provers; certification; novel applications of declarative
   programming inside and outside of CS; declarative programming
   pearls; practical experience reports and industrial application;
   education.

The PC chair will be happy to advise on the appropriateness of a topic.

Submission Categories
---------------------

Submissions can be made in three categories:

 - Research Papers,
 - System Descriptions,
 - Experience Reports.

Submissions of Research Papers must present original research which is
unpublished and not submitted elsewhere. They must not exceed 12 pages
ACM style 2-column (including figures, but excluding bibliography).
Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally
published workshop proceedings may be submitted (please contact the PC
chair in case of questions). Research papers will be judged on
originality, significance, correctness, clarity, and readability.

Submission of System Descriptions must describe a working system whose
description has not been published or submitted elsewhere. They must not exceed
10 pages and should contain a link to a working system. System Descriptions must
be marked as such at the time of submission and will be judged on originality,
significance, usefulness, clarity, and readability.

Submissions of Experience Reports are meant to help create a body of published,
refereed, citable evidence where declarative programming such as functional,
logic, answer-set, constraint programming, etc., is used in practice. They must
not exceed 5 pages **including references**.  Experience Reports must be marked
as such at the time of submission and need not report original research results.
They will be judged on significance, usefulness, clarity, and readability.

Supplementary material may be provided via a link to an extended
version of the submission (recommended), or in a clearly marked appendix
beyond the above-mentioned page limits. Reviewers are not required to
study extended versions or any material beyond the respective page
limit.

Formating Guidelines
———————————

We plan to use the same publication arrangements as PPDP has had in previous years.

For each paper category, you must use the most recent version of the "Current
ACM Master Template" which is available at
<https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template>. The most recent version
at the time of writing is 1.75. You must use the LaTeX sigconf proceedings
template as the conference organizers are unable to process final submissions in
other formats. In case of problems with the templates, contact ACM's TeX support
team at Aptara <acmtexsupport@aptaracorp.com>.

Authors should note ACM's statement on author's rights (http://authors.acm.org/)
which apply to final papers. Submitted papers should meet the requirements of
ACM's plagiarism policy
(http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy).

Requirements for Publication
----------------------------

At least one author of each accepted submission will be expected to
attend and present the work at the conference. The PC chair may retract
a paper that is not presented. The PC chair may also retract a paper if
complaints about the paper's correctness are raised which cannot be
resolved by the final paper deadline.
